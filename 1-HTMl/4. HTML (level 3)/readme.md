# Web Development Practice Repository

## Hi everyone! I'm Asia Ashraf.

I've been practicing **HTML** and **web development**, and to improve my skills, I created a collection of hands-on exercises. These exercises cover various concepts and techniques in HTML, making it easier for me to learn and for others to practice along the way.

This repository was created to **my class follow**, who are preparing for exams, and it is designed to help me and others practice key concepts in **HTML**.

**HTML**.
